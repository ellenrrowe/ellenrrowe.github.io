       <p>Hi Mrs Hoogstra,
I miss seeing you and hearing your laugh. I hope that we can get together sometime soon! I hope that you are enjoying your time at your new school. I'm so sorry that I was sick the day that you came to visit! I hope that you had an awesome birthday on Thursday! I also hope that you had a smooth move and are enjoying your new-ish house! Happy Birthday!<em>-Hannah</em></p>
